# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals

In this project, we will attempt to build a machine learning predictor model to know if a credit card application will get approved. 
Supervised Learning with scikit-learn and Data Manipulation with pandas will be used. This project is created through the Datacamp guided projects.
